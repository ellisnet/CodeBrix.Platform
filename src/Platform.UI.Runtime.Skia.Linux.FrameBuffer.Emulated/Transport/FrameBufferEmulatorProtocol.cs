/// <summary>
/// The frame-buffer emulator transport protocol, version 1 — the contract
/// between CodeBrix.Develop (the server: it creates the shared-memory file and
/// the listening socket BEFORE launching the app) and this emulated
/// frame-buffer head (the client: it maps the file, connects, and powers off —
/// libc _exit — the moment the socket reaches end-of-file).
/// <para>
/// KEEP IN SYNC, TEXTUALLY, with the IDE-side implementation in the
/// CodeBrix.Develop repo (src/CodeBrix.Develop.Emulation/FrameBuffer/Transport,
/// FrameBufferEmulatorProtocol.cs). The IDE cannot reference CodeBrix.Platform,
/// so the protocol is implemented twice from this one definition.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// LAUNCH CONTRACT — environment variables set by the IDE on the app process:
/// CODEBRIX_FBEMU_SHM_PATH (absolute path of the shared-memory file, created
/// and sized by the IDE), CODEBRIX_FBEMU_SOCKET_PATH (absolute path of the
/// Unix stream socket), CODEBRIX_FBEMU_WIDTH and CODEBRIX_FBEMU_HEIGHT (device
/// pixels, decimal strings). The head asserts the env resolution matches the
/// shared-memory header and hard-fails on mismatch (resolution lockstep).
/// CODEBRIX_FBEMU_LANGUAGE carries the emulated device's system language as one
/// of the software keyboard's layout ids ("de", "fr-CH", "sr-Latn"…), or the
/// literal "system-default" to follow the host's own language. The IDE always
/// sets it — "system-default" is sent explicitly, so an ABSENT variable means an
/// IDE that predates the setting, which the head treats the same as the default.
/// It is read ONCE at startup and never changes for the process's life: the
/// environment is fixed at launch, so a language change in the IDE takes effect
/// the next time the emulator opens. There is no lockstep check for it — an
/// empty or unrecognized value falls back to the host language rather than
/// failing the launch.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// SHARED MEMORY — a 64-byte little-endian header (field offsets below), then
/// two page-aligned pixel slots of height*stride bytes each, top-down rows,
/// BGRA8888 premultiplied (matches SKColorType.Bgra8888/Premul and Cairo
/// ARGB32 on little-endian). The head renders frame N into slot N % 2, then
/// atomically stores LatestSequence = N, then sends FrameReady(N) on the
/// socket. Sequence 0 means "no frame yet". The IDE reads on its own tick:
/// s1 = LatestSequence, blit slot s1 % 2, s2 = LatestSequence; if
/// s2 &gt;= s1 + 2 the slot may have been rewritten mid-blit, so re-blit.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// SOCKET — SOCK_STREAM, fixed 16-byte little-endian messages: uint32 type,
/// then three uint32 payload fields a/b/c. Head to IDE: Hello (a = protocol
/// version, b = head pid, c = capability bits; sent once immediately after
/// connect; the IDE closes the socket on version mismatch, which powers the
/// head off) and FrameReady (a = sequence low 32, b = sequence high 32,
/// c = slot index; advisory — the header is authoritative). IDE to head:
/// TouchPress / TouchMove / TouchRelease (a = x, b = y in DEVICE pixels,
/// c = pointer id — the IDE's single mouse-finger always sends 0; the head
/// honors whatever id arrives, so multi-touch senders need no head change)
/// and KeyDown / KeyUp (a = the WinUI VirtualKey, b = the X11-style hardware
/// keycode = evdev scancode + 8, c = the Unicode codepoint for text input or
/// 0 for none; the head tracks modifier state itself from the modifier keys'
/// down/up, and V1 of the IDE sends no key messages at all — the capability
/// ships dormant so enabling keyboard forwarding later is an IDE-only
/// change), and SetOrientation (a = the DEVICE's new orientation as one of the
/// Orientation* wire values; b and c unused). There is deliberately NO shutdown
/// message: shutdown IS the socket closing.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// ORIENTATION — SetOrientation carries the orientation of the DEVICE, not of
/// the application: how the emulated device is being held. The head works out
/// what that means for the application itself, honoring
/// DisplayInformation.AutoRotationPreferences: if the new device orientation is
/// one the application accepts, it re-lays-out so its UI is right-side-up for
/// that orientation, otherwise NOTHING changes and it stays as it was (sideways
/// or upside-down, exactly like a locked application on a turned device). The
/// value is ABSOLUTE, never a delta, so it is idempotent and re-synchronizes if
/// anything is ever missed. The IDE sends it immediately after the head's Hello
/// whenever the emulator window is already rotated, so what the user sees is
/// what a freshly-launched application gets.
