/// In an application the two registrations below are generated into the App's code-behind: the
/// XAML generator walks the referenced assemblies for their extension attributes and emits one
/// registration call each, gated on the operating system. A UIReqs project has no XAML and no
/// App, so nothing is generated - and the failure that causes is the quietest one in this whole
/// suite. The element still builds, its template still applies, its transport controls still
/// draw, and every Play, Pause and Position is a silent no-op against a player that has no
/// engine behind it. That is why the group's registration hook ASSERTS the registration rather
/// than trusting it.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Both must run before the first element is built: the player extension is created from the
/// <c>MediaPlayer</c> constructor, which the element runs as it applies its template, and the
/// presenter extension from the <c>MediaPlayerPresenter</c> constructor, which is part of that
/// same template. A module initializer is the only hook early enough.
