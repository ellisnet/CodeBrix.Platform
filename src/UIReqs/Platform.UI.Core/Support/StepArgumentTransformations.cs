/// How a quoted value in a feature file becomes the type a step definition asks for. Reqnroll
/// picks the transformation by the step's parameter type, so a step can simply take a

/// A coverage group that needs another conversion adds it as a

/// <c>StepArgumentTransformations.&lt;Group&gt;.cs</c>, or in a binding class of its own, since
/// Reqnroll collects them from every binding class in the assembly. A partial CLASS admits as
/// many files as there are groups; only a partial METHOD would be single-occupancy, which is
/// why no registration hook of this harness is one. One conversion per parameter type: two
/// transformations returning the same type make every step that takes it ambiguous.
