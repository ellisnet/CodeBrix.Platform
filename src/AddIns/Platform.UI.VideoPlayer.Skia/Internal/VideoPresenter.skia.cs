/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <b>Why it is called this.</b> Upstream this class is <c>SkiaVideoPresenter</c>, because the
/// playback engine has more than one presenter and that one is the SkiaSharp one. Inside the
/// CodeBrix.Platform family Skia is not a variant: it is the only way anything is drawn, so a
/// "Skia" in the name would mark a distinction that does not exist here. It is
/// <see cref="VideoPresenter"/>, and it is INTERNAL - an application uses the
/// <see cref="VideoPlayer"/> element, never a presenter. (Not to be confused with the engine's
/// <see cref="VideoFramePresenter"/>, which is the frame mailbox this class reads.)
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Why the add-in owns a copy at all.</b> The engine ships its own SkiaSharp presenter in
/// CodeBrix.VideoPlayback.Skia, for hosts outside this family. That package pins its own SkiaSharp
/// while this family pins one SkiaSharp for everything it ships, and an assembly compiled against
/// one SkiaSharp and run against another fails the moment SkiaSharp changes a signature it uses. So
/// the Skia-bound part of the engine lives here instead, compiled against the family's pin, and the
/// add-in depends on the drawing-free engine only. Everything that does NOT need a canvas - the
/// render paths, the letterbox arithmetic, the composed effect chain, the colour shader source, the
/// composition context - is taken from the engine and never re-declared.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>The shape of it.</b> The presenter never draws to a window. It owns an off-screen
/// <see cref="SKSurface"/>, draws the video into it as a base layer, runs <see cref="Layers"/> and
/// the <see cref="Composing"/> event over the top, and then either <see cref="Draw"/> blits that
/// surface into a canvas or <see cref="CurrentImage"/> hands it over for the frame driver to read
/// back. That indirection is the whole point: an off-screen surface is a canvas anybody can draw
/// on, which is what makes subtitles, heads-up overlays, annotation and picture-over-picture
/// possible without this class knowing about any of them.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Two render paths, both first class.</b> On the graphics path the three planes are uploaded as
/// single-channel textures and ONE shader does the colour conversion and the whole effect chain in
/// a single pass, at full sample precision. On the processor path the engine's vector converter
/// turns the frame into BGRA pixels straight into the composition surface's own memory, with no
/// copy at all. Neither is a degraded version of the other. <see cref="RenderPath"/> says which one
/// is wanted and what to do if it cannot be had; <see cref="ActiveRenderPath"/> says which one is
/// running.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Threading.</b> <see cref="Present"/> and <see cref="Attach"/> may be called from any thread.
/// Everything that touches the surface - <see cref="Update"/>, <see cref="Recompose"/>,
/// <see cref="Draw"/>, <see cref="CurrentImage"/>, <see cref="CaptureComposedFrame"/> - must be
/// called from ONE thread, the thread that owns the graphics context, which in this add-in is
/// always the user-interface thread. <see cref="Invalidated"/> is raised on whatever thread posted
