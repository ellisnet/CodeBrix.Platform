/// Two failures need this, and one of them is the most likely failure this AddIn will ever
/// produce. Every video this family authors carries AV1 video (the one exception a player can meet
/// is an uncompressed test track, which the playback core decodes itself), and AV1 decoding is BSD-2-Clause
/// rather than Apache-2.0, so it ships as a separate package that the APPLICATION references and
/// registers: until it does, every single file fails. Ogg Opus audio is the same story a size
/// smaller (BSD-3-Clause, a separate package, a separate registration call).
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The playback engine's own message already names the piece and the call - "video codec 'av01'
/// has no registered decoder - reference CodeBrix.VideoPlayback.Dav1d and call
/// CodeBrixVideoPlaybackDav1d.Register()". What it does not name is the NuGet package id, which
/// is what somebody has to type. This adds exactly that, and leaves every other failure alone.
