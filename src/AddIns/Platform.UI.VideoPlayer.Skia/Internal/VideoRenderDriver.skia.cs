/// The playback presenter is the off-screen surface that owns the composition; this class is the
/// ADAPTER that decides when a frame is composed, gets the graphics context the composition needs,
/// reads the result back to processor pixels in one copy, and hands the picture to the surface
/// element to blit. It is the video analogue of the CodeBrix.Platform.GameEngine host's GPU
/// render-surface adapter, and every lifetime rule here is that adapter's, for the same reasons:
/// </para>
/// <list type="number">
/// <item>The graphics context is created LAZILY, on the first frame after the element is loaded and
/// has a live XamlRoot - and the attempt is not latched before then, so the next frame retries.
/// One informational log line names the backend that was chosen; one warning (with the Windows
/// compatibility-pack hint) explains a failure, exactly once.</item>
/// <item>Teardown happens when the element leaves the visual tree, NOT at disposal. On WGL the
/// off-screen context is built on the window's own device context, so once the window is destroyed
/// every attempt to make it current fails and the graphics resources can never be released; and
/// continued dispatcher posting after the last window closed can keep a head's message loop from
/// draining. A volatile detached flag turns an already-queued tick into a no-op, re-entering the
/// tree re-arms driving, and the context is rebuilt lazily on the next frame - never in Loaded.</item>
/// <item>All graphics work happens on the user-interface thread inside ONE frame scope per frame.
/// The composition surface is released inside a frame scope BEFORE the context is disposed (both
/// scopes are no-ops on Metal).</item>
/// <item>Frame notifications arrive on the decode thread and are coalesced to a single queued tick,
/// latest wins, so a slow user-interface thread never accumulates a backlog.</item>
/// <item>One readback per frame into two alternating BGRA bitmaps, wrapped zero-copy and presented;
/// the previous wrapper is disposed by the surface element under its own gate.</item>
/// <item>A paused present is available so a seek reaches the screen with playback stopped - and,
/// when there is nothing to decode, it rebuilds the picture from the frame already on screen, so a
/// change to the effect chain or the layers reaches a paused screen too.</item>
/// <item>Whether the graphics path came up is what the element reports as its active render
/// path, and the presented picture is the screenshot hook.</item>
/// </list>
/// <para>
/// The presenter is recreated after a detach rather than kept: releasing its composition surface
/// inside the dying context's frame scope is what rule 3 asks for, and disposal is the one way its
/// public surface offers to do that. Nothing is lost - the mailbox it reads belongs to the playback
/// session, so the picture simply resumes.
