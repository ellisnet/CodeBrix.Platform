/// The bindable properties match <see cref="AudioPlayer"/> exactly - <see cref="Position"/> /
/// <see cref="PositionSeconds"/> follow playback and seek when written (debounced for

/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// LOADING IS ASYNCHRONOUS, which is the one way this differs from <see cref="AudioPlayer"/>.
/// Instruments are large - a sampled piano is hundreds of megabytes of decoded audio and takes

/// <see cref="MediaFailed"/> reports a load that did not get there. Both events are raised on the

/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Instruments are cached across every <see cref="MidiPlayer"/> in the application, so two players

/// engine's own process-wide cache, so a player and an application that pre-loaded the same path
/// through CodeBrix.Audio share one copy as well. That sharing has a consequence worth knowing:
